# Hell-of-a-job

Hell of a Job is a chaotic top-down party game set in the fiery depths of hell.

You work for the Devil himself, but even demons need a break — and there’s only one vacation ticket up for grabs. To win it, you must collect as many resources as possible while competing against your rival. The one who gathers the most will earn a well-deserved escape from the underworld.

But it’s not just about hoarding resources. You can hurl what you’ve gathered at your opponent to knock them off the map, sabotaging their progress and buying yourself precious time. Every match becomes a frantic back-and-forth of collecting, dodging, and sabotaging as you fight for your chance at freedom.

Fast-paced, competitive, and delightfully devilish — do you have what it takes to win the Devil’s vacation ticket?

In the depths of hell, collect as many souls as you can and throw them at your opponent to sabotage them and satisfy your boss.

This game was created by students during the 3rd edition of the club C.U.B.E. at the school Nad-UQAC (based in Montreal).
